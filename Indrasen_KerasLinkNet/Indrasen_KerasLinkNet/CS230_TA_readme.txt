This submission is for the LinkNet portion of the project checkpoint.

All the folders are according to the GitHub code on: https://github.com/davidtvs/Keras-LinkNet

The python notebooks in the 'preprocessing' folder were used for data processing for the following functions:
- convert greyscale images to RGB
- random selection of train/val/test datasets
- upsampling of images
- visualization of images and radon transform

The examples folder contains a couple of training examples (both raw image and labeled image)

I decided not to include the *.h5 trained network weights since they were rather large datasets.
